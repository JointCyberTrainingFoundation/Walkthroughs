# Challenge Prompt/Question

Seems like villians are using a new technique for hiding secrets from investigators. We recovered a file that appears to be written in the long lost language of Aurebesh. We need to know what message the villians are trying to transmit! Find the flag in cipher.pdf.



# Key

flag{y00wastedt1m3}


# Walkthrough
cipher.pdf has an image of Aurebesh text from Star Wars. When translated, it reads "Hope to have wasted your time." The flag is hidden in plaintext behind the image.
